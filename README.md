# Pyrite

Pyrite is a program that provides useful server tools for Minecraft


**Features:**
* Easy Server Creation (Vanilla Only & Certain Modpacks)
* World Copying
* Map Testing Mode (and Clearing Player Data)
* Server Hosting using ngrok

**DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible if you mess up your world files, your server files, or the directory the program is in if you don't specify the proper filenames.**

## Usage:
Pyrite v2 has a terminal like interface instead of Pyrite v1's set series of inputs. 
The following section will explain the different commands, what they are for, and how to use them.

### 'config':
> config <value> <set value>

This command is used to set various config variables. See the configuration section for more info.

### 'startServer':
This command can start a pre-existing server. If `ngrokDisabled` is set to false, running this command will also start ngrok.
